JS Seed
=======

Boilerplate for creating javascript libraries in ES6 with tests.


Features
========

- Source files written in [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) and transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
- Build file bundled with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).
- Exported in UMD format for use in all environments (including AMD / [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and CommonJS / [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) / [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)).
- Unit tests written with [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and run with [karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/).
- Unit test coverage with [isparta](https://github.com/douglasduteil/isparta) & [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul).
- Configuration managed by [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) and environment variables (development, production, test).
- Reports generated for unit test and coverage in HTML, txt, and json files.
- [Environment variables](./docs/development/environment-variables.md) to enable debugging and continuous integration support.
- Git hooks with [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) ensure tests and builds pass.
- Change log adhering to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/).
